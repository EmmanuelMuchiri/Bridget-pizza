## Description
This application gives customers a platform to order pizzas online and they may choose whether or not to have it delivered to them. The customers start by choosing the size of pizza they want, the crust and the type of topping they would like; they also input the number of pizzas they would like to order that. The number should not be less than one or exceed 5. They are then given the subtotal of the pizzas. The Grand total is the cost of subtotal and the delivery cost.
